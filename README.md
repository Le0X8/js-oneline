# js-oneline-generator

JavaScript allows you to write everything in a single line of code (with only one semicolon!). (This is more than one line for readability, but it works if you remove the line breaks!)

```js
($=>_=$=>[_,$()][0])()(()=>
  console.log('Hello,')
)(()=>
  console.log('world!')
);
```

There is no single use case for this, so don't actually use it.

Everything can be a one-liner in JS if you just try hard enough ;)
